            Linear Text is a graphical line-oriented plaintext editor by

            Linear Text is still in early development, may lose data, and is not
            ready for evaluation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application is installable as a web app or downloadable as a
            single file of self-contained, portable HTML. The web app is
            preferable for most since it executes as a standlone application
            instead of a browser tab and automatically updates. To install the
            web app, visit
            <a href="/edit">https://lineartext.com/edit</a> and click the
            installation prompt.

          <h2>Features</h2>
          <p>
            Linear Text represents each line of text as an editable card in a
            two-dimensional space. Same plaintext, different view.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Plaintext under a new lens. Read and write plaintext under a
              friendly, fun perspective without compromising data integrity. The
              format is plaintext, the presentation is graphical.
            </li>
            <li>Edit cards to edit lines.</li>
            <li>Move cards to move lines with drag-and-drop.</li>
            <li>Group cards to group lines.</li>
            <li>Indent cards to indent lines. Nested lines form a list.</li>
            <li>Show and hide cards by toggling lists.</li>
            <li>Switch to the integrated text editor for text mode.</li>
            <li>
              Seamlessly work with other text editors. External edits are
              live-reloaded.
            </li>
            <li>
              Work offline. Linear Text is a single file of self-contained HTML
              that executes locally on your computer. There are no uploads or
              transmissions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Designed to be deleted. Linear Text, like all editors, will become
              obsolete but your plaintext never will. The way electronic notes
              should be.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            From a to-do list to your life's work, see plaintext in a new light.

          <h2>Plaintext</h2>
          <p>
            Linear Text is for editing plaintext files. Plaintext is pure,
            immortal, and easy to work with.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Content is the focus. Plaintext is 100% content and unmarred by
              data format requirements imposed by software. There's nothing
              simpler, lighter weight, or less distracting than the fundamental
              data itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay in control. Plaintext can be structured across files and
              folders in any style.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep notes forever. Plaintext is universally readable. Text never
              needs to be migrated from an old tool to a new one.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find text easily. Plaintext is searchable. Text can be queried
              with any tool, especially by line.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compare texts. Plaintext can be diffed to review changes or
              identify differences.
            </li>
            <li>
              Version sensibly. Plaintext is interoperable with every popular
              version control system like Git.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Plaintext is the natural medium of computing.</p>

          <h2>Use-cases</h2>
          <p>Linear Text works well for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Outlining. Any kind of data that is hierarchically indented.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lists and collections. For example, game backlogs, bookmarks, and
              to-do lists.
            </li>
            <li>
              Simple kanbans, individual project management, and planning.
            </li>
            <li>Calendars and journaling.</li>
            <li>
              Note hoarding. Storing heaps of notes where important notes are
              bubbled up.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Principles</h2>
          <p>Linear Text was designed with these principles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Make it fun.</li>
            <li>
              The format is plaintext. Don't write anything you wouldn't write
              in notepad.exe. Linear markdown is ok.
            </li>
            <li>The line is the atom.</li>
            <li>Data is sacred.</li>
            <li>
              Information density is good. Lines are the focus. Distractions are
              bad.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Development</h2>
          <p>
            All code is <a href="https://git.io/linear-text">open-source</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Future work is focused on bug fixes and UI improvements. Exciting
            new features for link and image preview lenses is planned.
